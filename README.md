## Compile and Run the examples
SeiveSketch is implemented with C++. We show how to compile the examples on Ubuntu with g++ and make.

### Requirements
- Ensure g++ and make are installed. Our experimental platform is equipped with Ubuntu 20.04, g++ 9.4.0 and make 4.2.1.
- Ensure the necessary library libpcap is installed.
    - It can be installed by the following command 
        - `apt-get install libpcap-dev in Ubuntu`
